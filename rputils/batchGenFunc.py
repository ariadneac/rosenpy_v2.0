sequential or shuffled.

def batch_sequential(xp, x, y, batch_size=1):
    """
    Generates sequential batches of data for neural network training.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xp: str        
        CuPy/Numpy module. This parameter is set at the time of 
        initialization of the NeuralNetwork class.
    x: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_inputs)
        Training vectors as real numbers, where n_samples is the number of
        samples and n_inputs is the number of input features.
        
    y: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Target values are real numbers representing the desired outputs.
    
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch sizes. If the batch size is equal to 1, the algorithm will 
        be the SGD.The default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    array-like (n_batch, n_samples, n_inputs), array-like (n_batch, n_samples, n_outputs)
            Tensors that yields sequential batches of data.
