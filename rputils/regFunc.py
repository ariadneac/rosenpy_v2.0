This file contains a regularization function for applying L2 regularization.

"""


def l2_regularization(xp, lambda_init, reg_strength, epoch):
    """
    Calculates the L2 regularization factor for a given epoch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xp: str        
        CuPy/Numpy module. This parameter is set at the time of 
        initialization of the NeuralNetwork class.
    lambda_init : float
        The initial lambda value.
    reg_strength : float
        The initial lambda value.
    epoch : int
        The current epoch of the training process.
     
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The L2 regularization factor based on the given parameters.
